This project was part of my Data Mining course at university. It involves the analysis of Zachary's Karate Club graph, a well-known social network graph used in network analysis. The graph represents the relationships between 34 members of a karate club, with edges representing friendships between the members. The dataset contains information about two distinct clubs within the karate club, as identified by the "Mr. Hi" and "Officer" labels.  
Through this project, I performed various network analysis techniques, including community detection, node embeddings, and clustering, to uncover the structure and properties of the network. Key steps include:

* **Graph Construction**: Constructing the graph using NetworkX and visualizing the relationships between the members.  
* **Node Embeddings with Node2Vec**:Generating vector representations of graph nodes using the Node2Vec algorithm for analysis and learning tasks.  
* **K-Means Clustering**:Performing clustering on the node embeddings.  
* **Edge Prediction using Adamic-Adar Score**:Using the Adamic-Adar Index to predict potential future connections based on shared neighbors.  
* **Visualization and Evaluation**:Visualizing the results to identify meaningful groups or communities within the network, and evaluating the performance of predicted edges and comparing them to the actual test set.

This project is useful for gaining insights into how network structure influences community formation and predicting new connections in social networks.
